Hi,

welcome to my blog. This blog was originally supposed to be used for blogging
about my California experience but now it's mainly about maintaining a record
of some talks as well as sharing some thoughts with the world.

## Work
I'm a software engineer at Innovation Center @ SAP Labs Palo Alto. There
I mainly focus on building innovative solutions / products with bleeding edge
technologies in areas like Augmented Reality (Microsoft HoloLens or Google Tango) or
the Blockchain.
Before I gathered experience in SAP HANA database and JAVA backend
development by working as a Business Analytics Developer at SAP Labs Palo Alto.
Furthermore I also worked as a OracleDBA and JAVA Business Service Developer at
[OpRiskSolutions](http://www.operationalrisksolutions.com/en/) in Darmstadt, Germany.
